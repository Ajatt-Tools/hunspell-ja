# hunspell-ja-deinflection
Hunspell dictionary to deinflect all Japanese conjugated verbs to the dictionary form.

The conversion method is based on the next point to the word stem. For instance when faced with 書かない, you have to search for 書か. The advantage of this method is that it supports any kind of possible conjugation (slang, archaism, dialect,...) given that the stem word is included in the .dic file. For this purpose I have compiled every applicable entry from 広辞苑、大辞林、デジタル大辞泉、日本国語大辞典、旺文社国語辞典、明鏡国語辞典、新明解国語辞典 and JMDict.
