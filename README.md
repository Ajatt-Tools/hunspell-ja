## How to use
1. Download both ja_JP.aff and ja_JP.dic and save to your designated folder for GoldenDict morphology.
2. Quit GoldenDict and reopen it to let it automatically detect the added Japanese morphology.
3. Go to the Dictionary setting in the app, and enable the added morphology. Also add it to your Dict groups if you want.
4. It should be working now :)
